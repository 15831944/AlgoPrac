Algorithm Practice
===============

It is a place I practice implementing the most basic and pratical algorithms and data structure.I'll try my best to implement them in C language,however,I cannot promise each algorithm could run because there are really complcated algorithms and data structures and too many details should be taken into consideration with limited time. 

<h3>Algorithms Including</h3>

- Bit Manipulation
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming
- Sorting
- Searching
- String Matching
- Big Data

<h3>Data Structure Including</h3>

- Array
- Linked List
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Hash Tables
